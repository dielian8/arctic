Initial definition of the repository. Contains all available versions of ARCTIC. To be tested (maybe with qseis?). GUI needed.

1. Generation of setup (geometry and inversion parameters)

2. Generation of Greens Function (GF) database for given setup

3. Running inversion (Realtime/Monitoring or Event-based)
